# Installation Instructions

Install Yabai:
`$ brew install koekeishiya/formulae/yabai`

If you don't have the `brew` command; install Homebrew with:
`$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

Then grab the latest [release](https://github.com/LoopyLucy/Yabai-Control-Bar/releases), unpack it and drop the .app into your `Applications` folder. I would advise you then set the app to run at startup in `System Settings -> General -> Login Items`

This is an unsigned app, you will have to `right click the app and click open` first before MacOS will allow the app to run.
